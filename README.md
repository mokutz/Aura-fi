# Aura-fi
Aura-Fi AFI is a next-generation "Flatcoin" built on the Solana blockchain. Engineered in the wake of the 2022 market collapses, AFI moves away from fragile algorithmic models toward a Hardened Treasury system. By utilizing Solana Token-2022 extensions, Aura-Fi bakes economic stability and Active Governance rewards directly into the protocol's DNA.
